\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \hyperlink{classOutputBlendingNet}{Output\+Blending\+Net}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A modulatory network architecture which uses two plain backprop networks, each of which is trained separately. When the network is run, each subnetwork is run and the output generated by interpolating between the subnet outputs. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}


\subsection{Detailed Description}
Output blending network -\/ only works with 2 h-\/levels, 0 and 1, and only with S\+GD.
